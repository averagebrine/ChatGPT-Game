# ChatGPT-Game

A bash game written by OpenAI's ChatGPT. I had to help it a long a little bit, but it only took a minute and a few prompts to get this script.

ChatGPT can explain how to use the script:
>To execute the file called adventure.sh, you must first make sure that it has execute permissions. You can do this by running the command chmod +x adventure.sh, which will add execute permissions to the file. Once you have done this, you can run the file by typing ./adventure.sh in a terminal window.
